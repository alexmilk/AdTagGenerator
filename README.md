A simple, standalone instance that generates different ad tags from various ad systems such as VAST, DFP or VPAID. The ad tags are static and generated from a preset js file which can later be updated with new units.

## Getting Started

The instance is super simply, the menus beneath the form contain different ad units with a straightforward description of the unit itself such as "Single inline preroll". Once a unit is selected from the menu, its complete address will populate into the form where it can be copied from and used on the player.

## Compatibility
